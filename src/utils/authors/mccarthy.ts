  "You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from. There is no such thing as life without bloodshed. The world is hardly a place at all but instead a chronicle of chance and destiny.",

  "The man who believes that the secrets of the world are forever hidden lives in mystery and fear. Superstition will drag him down."
